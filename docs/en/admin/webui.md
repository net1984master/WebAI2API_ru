# Web Management Interface

WebAI2API provides a built-in Web Management Interface (WebUI) for monitoring and managing the service.

::: warning Note
The WebUI and management interfaces only use the API Token for authentication during the handshake phase. Transmissions are not encrypted. If you are using this on a public network, please use a professional web server like Caddy or Nginx to provide HTTPS encryption!
:::

## Access URL

```
http://localhost:3000
```

On your first visit, you will need to enter the API Token set in your configuration file (`auth` field) for authentication.
